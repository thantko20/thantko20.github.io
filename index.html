            <p>
                Howdy, partner! I'm Thant Ko Zaw from Myanmar. This is going to be my
                very first webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I have my burmese name, I'd like to get called Marco. Do you want to know
                why I'd like you to call me Marco? Well you can explore at my Hobbies tab
                which is at the top of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Oooh. I haven't told you about my webpage yet. Well this is part of the problem set 8 of
                <a href="https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home" target="_blank">
                    CS50
                </a>
                course. I have been enjoying the course so far. So in this problem, I have to
                make a homepage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and uhh some other stuffs
                called Bootstrap, jquery. But I won't be using so much Bootstrap here since
                I am not that familiar with it yet. But it's fun to mess around!
                This will not be the best looking web page you've seen so far.
                But hey, I'll try my best and be open to any suggestions!
            </p>
            <p>
                My weakest point in this webpage will be the flexbox which I haven't fully
                understood. Yes, I have time to make this perfect but this is just a simple page
                and I don't want to make it like <a href="www.facebook.com" target="_blank">
                Facebook</a>. Please understand me. And also, English is not my native tongue
                so it is very limited. If you have any courses to learn English, I'm open to
                suggestions.
            </p>
            <p class="last_p">
                Anyway, be free to look around.
            </p>
            <p class="last_p">
                Thank you very much!
            </p>
